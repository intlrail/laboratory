Compositioning Experiment 1

I'm trying to learn compositioning. Latly I've been thinking most of my patterns look boring and flat. Hopefully I can improve that by incorporating some composition techniques. Here is how I thought about this Pen:

* Focal point stands out from the rest
* There is a leading (diagonal) line towards the focal point
